# AOC2021 

Hi There :) 

I made a small project for holding my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 

If you want to steal this setup: 
- check out the branch `template` [here](https://github.com/Daniel-N-Huss/AOC2021/tree/template)
- clone that branch to your local
- step to the project folder
- `bundle install`

Currently uses Ruby 2.7.2 because I had that installed. Feel free to change your gemfile to whatever version is convenient to you.

Once you register on the website, you'll be given a selection of inputs to the problem.
I've been saving those as a .txt file in a folder called `inputs` at the project root, then reading them
in each response.

Naming scheme:
Each day has 2 problems, the base one and an extended problem once you solve it.
All my file names will be the day, and the problem attached:

ie. Day 1 files:
d1_1
d1_2
