# AOC2021 

Hi There :) 

I made a small project for holding my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) 

If you want to steal this setup: 
- check out the branch `template` [here](https://github.com/Daniel-N-Huss/AOC2021/tree/template)
- clone that branch to your local
- step to the project folder
- `bundle install`

Currently uses Ruby 2.7.2 because I had that installed. Feel free to change your gemfile to whatever version is convenient to you.
